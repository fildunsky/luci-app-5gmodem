# Point every install link in the five READMEs at release <version>-r<release>.
#
# Called by the publish job of build.yml ONLY after all packages are attached
# and the draft release is published - until then the links keep pointing at
# the previous release, which is still downloadable. Bumping them by hand in
# the release commit left a 15-20 minute window in which the README install
# command returned 404.
#
# Usage: readme-links.sh <version> <pkg_release>     e.g. readme-links.sh 2.4.65 1
